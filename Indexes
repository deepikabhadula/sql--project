Why indexes?
Indexes are used by queries to find data from tables quickly. Indexes are created on tables and views. Index on a table or a view, is very similar to an index that we find in a book. 

If you don't have an index in a book, and I ask you to locate a specific chapter in that book, you will have to look at every page starting from the first page of the book. 

On, the other hand, if you have the index, you lookup the page number of the chapter in the index, and then directly go to that page number to locate the chapter. 

Obviously, the book index is helping to drastically reduce the time it takes to find the chapter. 

In a similar way, Table and View indexes, can help the query to find data quickly. 

In fact, the existence of the right indexes, can drastically improve the performance of the query. If there is no index to help the query, then the query engine, checks every row in the table from the beginning to the end. This is called as Table Scan. Table scan is bad for performance. 

The following are the different types of indexes in SQL Server
1. Clustered
2. Nonclustered
3. Unique
4. Filtered
5. XML
6. Full Text
7. Spatial
8. Columnstore
9. Index with included columns
10. Index on computed columns

Clustered Index:
A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. For this reason, a table can have only one clustered index. 

Create tblEmployees table using the script below.
CREATE TABLE [tblEmployee]
(
 [Id] int Primary Key,
 [Name] nvarchar(50),
 [Salary] int,
 [Gender] nvarchar(10),
 [City] nvarchar(50)
)

Create Clustered Index IX_tblEmployee_Name
ON tblEmployee(Name)
